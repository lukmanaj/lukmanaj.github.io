I am a dedicated professional with a solid foundation in Pharmacy, specializing in leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Biomedical Informatics. Currently, I am employed at Zipline, where I contribute to the delivery of medical supplies using innovative drone technology. My focus is on harnessing technology to improve healthcare accessibility and effectiveness, particularly in areas that have limited access to traditional medical services.

My interests span across several domains, including data-driven healthcare solutions, computational drug discovery, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Each of these interests fuels my dedication to making healthcare smarter and more efficient. Whether it's optimizing the logistics of healthcare delivery, developing predictive models for disease outbreaks, or finding novel ways to apply AI in drug discovery, I am passionate about finding impactful and sustainable solutions.

Beyond my professional work, I am also an active mentor and advocate for the next generation of data scientists and healthcare professionals, sharing my knowledge to inspire others to explore the exciting possibilities that data and technology bring to healthcare.

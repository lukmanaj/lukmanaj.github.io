# Welcome to My Personal Website

Welcome! My name is Lukman Jibril Aliyu, and I am a pharmacist committed to advancing Biomedical Informatics and Artificial Intelligence to improve healthcare outcomes. My work stands at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and data, and I hope to create solutions that address critical challenges in healthcare delivery, especially in underserved areas.

This website highlights my projects, publications, and the journey that has taken me from pharmacy practice to the cutting-edge fields of Biomedical Informatics and AI. My work touches upon Global Health, Epidemiology, and Biostatisticsâ€”each of these domains contributing towards my overarching goal of transforming healthcare through data-driven innovations. From improving medical supply chains and logistics, to modeling disease dynamics, to applying biostatistical methods for personalized interventions, my focus remains on impactful solutions for real-world health challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects and publications to understand more about my passion for harnessing technology to build a healthier world.

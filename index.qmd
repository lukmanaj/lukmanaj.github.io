# Welcome to My Personal Website

My name is Lukman Jibril Aliyu, and I am a pharmacist dedicated to advancing Biomedical Informatics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve healthcare outcomes. My work lies at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and data, aiming to develop innovative solutions that address critical challenges in healthcare delivery, particularly in underserved areas.

This website showcases my projects, publications, and the journey that has taken me from pharmacy practice to the forefront of Biomedical Informatics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and AI. My research spans Global Health, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics, with a strong focus on data-driven innovations. Notably, my work in NLP includes developing language technologies for underrepresented languages like Hausa and leveraging AI to improve clinical text processing and understanding.

From improving medical supply chains and logistics, to modeling disease dynamics, to applying biostatistical methods for personalized interventions, my focus remains on creating impactful, scalable solutions for real-world health challenges.

I invite you to explore my projects, publications, and NLP research contributions to learn more about my passion for harnessing technology to build a healthier world.
